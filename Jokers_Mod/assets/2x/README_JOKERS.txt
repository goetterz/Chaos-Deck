JOKER SPRITE INSTRUCTIONS
========================

To add custom joker images:

1. Create a file called "jokers.png" in this folder
2. The image should be 71x95 pixels per joker
3. If you have multiple jokers, arrange them in a grid
4. Update the pos = {x, y} coordinates in jokers.lua for each joker

Example for one joker:
- Image size: 71x95 pixels
- Position: {x = 0, y = 0}

Example for multiple jokers in a 2x2 grid:
- Image size: 142x190 pixels (71*2 x 95*2)
- Joker 1: {x = 0, y = 0} (top-left)
- Joker 2: {x = 1, y = 0} (top-right)  
- Joker 3: {x = 0, y = 1} (bottom-left)
- Joker 4: {x = 1, y = 1} (bottom-right)

For now, you can:
1. Find/create a 71x95 pixel image for Alec Mukbang
2. Save it as "jokers.png" in this folder
3. The game will automatically use it!
