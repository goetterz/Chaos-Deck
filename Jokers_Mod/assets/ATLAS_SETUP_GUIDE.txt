JOKER ATLAS SETUP GUIDE
========================

The stretching issue is because Balatro expects joker atlases to be formatted in a very specific way.

PROBLEM: Your current 71x95 image is being treated as containing multiple jokers arranged in a grid.

SOLUTION OPTIONS:

Option 1: Single Joker Atlas (Recommended)
------------------------------------------
1. Create image exactly 71x95 pixels
2. Make sure there's some transparent padding around the actual artwork
3. The joker face should be centered, not filling the entire frame
4. Save as PNG with transparency

Option 2: Use Default Sprite Temporarily  
-----------------------------------------
The joker is currently set to use default appearance while functionality works.
Test that the eating mechanic works first, then worry about the image.

Option 3: Multi-Joker Atlas (For Future)
-----------------------------------------
If you want multiple custom jokers later:
- Create image that's 142x95 (2 jokers wide) or 71x190 (2 jokers tall)
- Arrange jokers in a grid
- Update pos = {x, y} coordinates for each joker

CURRENT STATUS:
- Atlas is commented out
- Joker uses default appearance  
- All functionality (eating food jokers, gaining mult) should work
- Focus on testing the mechanics first!

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test the joker in-game - make sure it eats food jokers correctly
2. Once mechanics work, we'll fix the image display
3. Your image needs transparent padding - the artwork shouldn't go to the very edges
